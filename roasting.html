        <p>There are lots of ways to roast coffee, but all involve heating green beans until the sugars caramelize and potentially begin to burn. You can buy a commercial machine that is purpose-built for roasting or can do it in a hot air popcorn popper or even in a frying pan on your stovetop.</p>
        <p>However you do it, make sure you have plenty of ventilation, as roasting coffee can produce a lot of smoke. If indoors, I recommend doing it under a strong range hood or next to a window with a box fan.</p>

            <td>French Roast</td>
            <td>Dark brown. Starts to taste burnt. All sugars are caramelized. Often shiny because the oil is pushed out.</td>
